# OSVidCAP: a Framework for the Simultaneous Recognition and Description of Concurrent Actions in Videos in an Open-Set Scenario


## Introduction

Automatically understanding and describing the visual content of videos in natural language is a challenging task. Most current approaches are designed to describe single events in a closed-set setting. However, in real-world scenarios, concurrent activities and previously unseen actions may appear ina video.
The OSVidCap is a novel open-set video captioning framework that recognizes and describes, in natural language, concurrent known actions and detects the unknown ones. It is based on the encoder-decoder framework and uses a detection-and-tracking-object-based mechanism followed by a background blurring method to focus on specific targets in a video. Additionally, the TI3D Network with the Extreme Value Machine (EVM) is also used to learn representations and recognize unknown actions.
